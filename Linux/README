*Linux services:

Check if service is running or port is open.
Macro can handle multiple services, but it needs 3 values, comma separated, each service separated by semicolon. Example macro setup:

{$SERVICE_CHECK} = java,,;;,run,/usr/something.py
This checks if java is present in any status, and something.py is in run state.

Triggers if returns 0 (enumerates services, so 0 named services are in named status)

{$PORT_CHECK} = 22,tcp;3306,tcp;6379,udp
This checks if tcp 22, tcp 3306 and udp 6379 is open.

Triggers if returns 0 (means port is not open)

*Linux log monitoring:

Checks if specified logfile includes filter (regex), triggers with specified severity: 1-info, 2-warning, 3-average, 4-high, 5-disaster
Accepts multiple entries (either same file with different filter, or different file entirely), json format
{$LOGCHECK} = {"data":[{"{#LOGFILE}":"/var/log/syslog","{#FILTER}":"[bB]ig[eE]rror[0-9]","{#SEVERITY}":"5"},{"{#LOGFILE}":"","{#FILTER}":"[sS]mall[eE]rror[a-zA-Z0-9]*","{#SEVERITY}":"3"}]}

Triggers if filter is input into the logfile.
